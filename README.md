# Skin-Cancer-Detection-Using_DEEPCNN
* Skin cancer detection is a challenging problem that requires identifying subtle differences in the appearance of skin lesions. In order to accurately detect skin cancer, a model must be able to capture these subtle differences and learn to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions.
* Used Xception model is well-suited for this task because it is a deep convolutional neural network that is capable of learning complex features from images. By using depthwise separable convolutions and residual connections, the Xception model is able to efficiently learn a large number of features from skin lesion images, which can then be used to distinguish between benign and malignant lesions.
* In addition, Xception has been shown to be highly accurate on a range of image classification tasks, including skin cancer detection, which makes it a popular choice for researchers and practitioners working in this area.
